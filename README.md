Welcome, *traveler*, to my humble abode on the digital realm. I'm an ancient wanderer in the vast landscape of code and technology. 👨‍💻 👩‍💻

⚔️I am a red-teamer and a security professional, much like an ancient warrior. My expertise lies in the art of battle, using my knowledge of security vulnerabilities to infiltrate and test the defenses of organizations. I think like an attacker, and use my skills to identify and exploit weaknesses in the systems.⚔️

🗿I am also a fierce defender, using my skills to protect against real-world threats and keep the network safe. I am the unsung hero of the modern cyber battlefield, standing guard against cyber threats and keeping the organization's assets safe.🗿



<h2>Only brave can win!</h2>
