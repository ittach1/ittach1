Welcome, *traveler*, to my humble abode on the digital realm. I'm Subbu, an ancient wanderer in the vast landscape of code and technology. 👨‍💻 👩‍💻

I am a red-teamer and a security professional, much like an ancient warrior. My expertise lies in the art of battle, using my knowledge of security vulnerabilities to infiltrate and test the defenses of organizations. I think like an attacker, and use my skills to identify and exploit weaknesses in the systems.

I am also a fierce defender, using my skills to protect against real-world threats and keep the network safe. I am the unsung hero of the modern cyber battlefield, standing guard against cyber threats and keeping the organization's assets safe. 🛡️


>Are you an ancient warrior who has sworn to protect companies and willing to compete on a modern cyber battlefield? ⚡⚡
